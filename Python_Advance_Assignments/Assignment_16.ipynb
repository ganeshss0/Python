    "Regular expression makes it easy to find any kind of pattern inside a string, regular expression is way more efficient than `for` and `while` loops. By using regular expression our code would  be small and easy to maintain, The pattern matching algorithm of regular expression is more fast than `for` and `while` loops."

In this situation we have to `[0-7]` expression inside our pattern."
